At [SFPC](http://sfpc.io/) this week our teacher (and my friend!) [Sarah Aoun](https://twitter.com/sa0un) talked about how surveillance has always been tied to colonialism and race. In the article [Colonial oversight](https://www.redpepper.org.uk/colonial-oversight/) Elia Zureik says: "It is significant that the basic tools of surveillance as we know them today (fingerprinting, census taking, map-making and profiling ‚Äì including the forerunners of present day biometrics) were refined and implemented in colonial settings, notably by the Dutch in Southeast Asia, the French in Africa, and the British in India and North America."

It got me thinking about a couple of things relating to the use of data by corporations:

-  Companies like Facebook and Google using our data for personalization and advertising.
- Cambridge Analytica using Facebook data on millions of people to "influence" the 2016 election cycle. (I do believe Facebook data was harvested, not convinced about the influence part).
- Unsurprisingly, Cambridge Analytica [tried out their psychological operations](https://qz.com/1089911/bell-pottinger-and-cambridge-analyticas-work-in-south-africa-kenya-is-raising-questions/) in Africa before they went to the west. "A former employee of the company who spoke to the Guardian said it used these 'psychological operations' to win elections 'in the kind of developing countries that don‚Äôt have many rules.'"
- [The Right to be Forgotten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten)."In May 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union ordered Google and other search engines that operate in Europe to allow individuals to ask the sites to delist certain search results relating to a person's name, if the information is inadequate, irrelevant or excessive in relation to the purposes of the processing."

It also (this is tangentially related) got me thinking about the use of personal data by individuals on social media. At [Afrotectopia](https://www.afrotectopia.com/) last week I led a think tank called "Boycotting in the Digital Age. While I was doing research for the think tank I stumbled upon a website I remembered from my freshman year in college: the [your fave is problematic](http://yourfaveisproblematic.tumblr.com/). It was (it's now abandoned) a tumlbr page that "called out a wide range of potentially offensive behaviors by celebrities. Its title became an adage (and frequent headline), meaning 'The people and works you love often do harmful things.'" If you are familiar with the idea of 'receipts' on social media, the tumblr page is basically a database of receipts. The idea of 'receipts' started with an interview Whitney Houston did with Diane Sawyer where she said 'I wanna see the receipts' after Sawyer mentioned a headline portraying Houston as an addict. 

[![Whitney Houston, Show me the receipts](http://img.youtube.com/vi/AdyaLWMt6qA/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/AdyaLWMt6qA "Show me the receipts")

Frequently on social media, old tweets ("receipts") are resurfaced and used to berate people and declare them 'cancelled.' [See Cardi B, tw: transphobia](https://globalgrind.cassiuslife.com/4233283/cardi-b-under-fire-for-transphobic-and-racist-comments/) (If you are wondering, yes this blog post is just a guise to get you hip with social media slang). When Cardi deleted her transphobic tweets, someone responded saying 'there are always screenshots.' 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Well it&#39;s official Cardi b is cancelled. It was fun while it lasted. <a href="https://t.co/XcISPs8DYQ">pic.twitter.com/XcISPs8DYQ</a></p>&mdash; üêùüëëü¶Ñ (@Bonjour_Bish) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bonjour_Bish/status/895489703000014848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2017</a></blockquote>

While I am in little to no danger of being dragged on social media because 1) I am not a celebrity or twitter famous 2) I doubt anyone would care  3) I try not to say stupid shit, I have been thinking a lot about the person I was before. More specifically, I've been thinking of the person I was in high school and during my freshman year of college. Before I go on, I want to share something from poet I love, Kaveh Akbar. It's related so stay with me. He says about navigating issues of race and privilege in poetry: "I think that one of the real risks of white poets writing about race is that it often seems to me that they get mired in what Ta-Nehisi Coates calls 'the politics of personal exoneration:' the idea that they‚Äôll write a poem about an uncle saying the n-word, and you know, they didn‚Äôt say anything when it happened, and it‚Äôs almost like their confession. And then they‚Äôre asking the presumed PoC audience to be absolutionists, to say, 'absolve me for my sin of complicity.'" 

Before we dig through some of my old tweets I want to mention that:

- I am not looking for personal exoneration
- I am not saying we need to forgive and forget people's past. A lot of times an apology isn't enough (e.g [national geographic](https://twitter.com/tired_ugly_/status/973606454333792257). I don't have a conclusion here just a question. I am uncomfortable with a standard that leaves people forever bounded to an identity or past behavior and leaves no room to grow.  

Yesterday, I spent some time going through old tweets (from like 2012 when I was 16) and they reminded me of some of the people I've been. I exhibited a lot of problematic behaviour and one of them was homophobia. I don't know if there's a benefit to showing the tweets here so I'm not going to but the point is I have "receipts". I have said harmful things and proof of that is out there. If you want to you can find them [here](https://twarc.glitch.me/YellzHeard) after a bit of scrolling. 

While the use of personal data by individuals and the use by companies is very different, and one is by far more dangerous than the other, they both involve using data and history as weapons. They both leave little room for change or growth. Ads for alcohol don't stop when you get sober or are trying to. ["If you experience miscarriage there is no power on earth that can unsubscribe you from the ad tracking that pregnant women get."](https://twitter.com/beeonaposy/status/969679864407175169). 

All this to say I'm thinking of making some kind of art installation with my old tweets for my final project at SFPC. I made a collection of the worst of the worst.I am not scared of them being out there because I hope my interactions and relationships now serve as proof that I am a different and better person _but_ I do feel some uneasiness because of the way data binds us.
